// In lib/profile-data.ts
skills: [
  {
    name: 'New Skill',
    category: 'Design',
    proficiency: 'Expert',
    yearsOfExperience: 3,
    description: 'Description of your expertise'
  }
]
```

#### Projects
```typescript
// In lib/profile-data.ts
projects: [
  {
    title: 'New Project',
    description: 'Project description',
    duration: 'Q1 2024',
    role: 'Lead Designer',
    keyAchievements: ['Achievement 1', 'Achievement 2'],
    skillsUsed: ['Skill 1', 'Skill 2'],
    impact: 'Project impact description',
    industry: 'Industry name',
    teamSize: 'Team size description',
    methodologies: ['Method 1', 'Method 2']
  }
]
```

#### Experience
```typescript
// In lib/profile-data.ts
experience: [
  {
    title: 'New Role',
    company: 'Company Name',
    duration: '2023 - Present',
    description: 'Role description',
    keyResponsibilities: ['Responsibility 1', 'Responsibility 2'],
    achievements: ['Achievement 1', 'Achievement 2'],
    skills: ['Skill 1', 'Skill 2']
  }
]
```

### Adding New Demo Jobs
```typescript
// In lib/demo-jobs.ts
export const demoJobs: JobRequirement[] = [
  {
    title: 'New Job Title',
    description: 'Job description',
    requiredSkills: ['Skill 1', 'Skill 2'],
    preferredSkills: ['Preferred Skill 1'],
    experience: '2+ years',
    industry: 'Industry Name',
    responsibilities: ['Responsibility 1', 'Responsibility 2']
  }
]
```

### Modifying Scoring Weights
```typescript
// In lib/ai-analysis.ts
const overallScore = Math.round(
  (skillMatch * 0.4 + experienceMatch * 0.3 + projectMatch * 0.2 + industryMatch * 0.1)
)
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### 1. **External AI Integration**
Currently uses local analysis algorithms. To integrate with external AI:

```typescript
// In lib/ai-analysis.ts
export async function analyzeJobMatchWithAI(jobReq: JobRequirement): Promise<MatchResult> {
  // Call external AI API (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
  const aiResponse = await callAIAPI(jobReq, profileData)
  return parseAIResponse(aiResponse)
}
```

### 2. **Custom Scoring Rules**
Add industry-specific or role-specific scoring:

```typescript
function calculateCustomScore(jobReq: JobRequirement, profile: ProfileData): number {
  // Add custom logic for specific industries or roles
  if (jobReq.industry === 'Healthcare') {
    return calculateHealthcareScore(jobReq, profile)
  }
  return 0
}
```

### 3. **Analytics Integration**
Track usage and improve the system:

```typescript
// Add analytics tracking
const trackAnalysis = (jobReq: JobRequirement, result: MatchResult) => {
  analytics.track('role_match_analysis', {
    jobTitle: jobReq.title,
    industry: jobReq.industry,
    overallScore: result.overallScore,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })
}
```
